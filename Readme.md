In my early days of programming, I have been working with C to
understand logic, sorting, counting, vectors, and string manipulation.

One of the first things I learned when studying C programming was about 
sequential structures. After that the second thing I learned in c programming 
was conditional structures (if, if else, else).My last basic strcture was repetition using for and while.
